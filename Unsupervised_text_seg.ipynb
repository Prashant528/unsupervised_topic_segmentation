This section lists the documents\\nthat describe these methodologies. The following list is ordered: you\\nare strongly recommended to go through these documents in the order\\npresented.\\n\\n1. [Setting up your engine development environment](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment),\\n   which describes the steps you need to configure your computer to\\n   work on Flutter\\'s engine.

[Tree hygiene](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene),\\n   which covers how to land a PR, how to do code review, how to\\n   handle breaking changes, how to handle regressions, and how to\\n   handle post-commit test failures.\\n\\n4. [Our style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo),\\n   which includes advice for designing APIs for Flutter, and how to\\n   format code in the framework.\\n\\n5. [Flutter design doc template](https://flutter.dev/go/template),\\n   which should be used when proposing a new technical design.  This is a good\\n   practice to do before coding more intricate changes.\\n   See also our [guidance for writing design docs](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Design-Documents).\\n\\n[![How to contribute to Flutter](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4yBgOBAOx_A/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBgOBAOx_A)\\n\\nIn addition to the documents, there is a video linked above on **How to contribute to Flutter**\\nfrom the [Flutter](https://youtube.com/c/flutterdev) YouTube channel,\\nthere are many pages on [our Wiki](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/),\\nand an article [Contributing to Flutter: Getting Started](https://medium.com/@ayushbherwani/contributing-to-flutter-getting-started-a0db68cbcd5b)\\non Medium that may be of interest.
